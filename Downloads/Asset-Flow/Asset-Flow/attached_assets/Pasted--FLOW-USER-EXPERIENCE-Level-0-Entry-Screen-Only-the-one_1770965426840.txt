🧠 FLOW (USER EXPERIENCE)
🟢 Level 0 – Entry Screen

“Only the one who owns my heart can unlock this.”
Button: Start the Game 💖

🔐 LEVEL 1 – Memory Lock

Question example

“When did we first talk? (DD/MM/YYYY)”

🧩 LEVEL 3 – Code Heart Puzzle

She must arrange emojis / words:

[❤️] [YOU] [ME] [FOREVER]


Correct order unlocks chatbot.

🤖 LEVEL 4 – CHATBOT (THE MAGIC PART)
🎭 Bot Personality

The bot pretends to be:

“Someone who knows how much she means to you…”

💬 Sample Chat Flow

Bot opens with:

“Hi… I was built just for you. Want to talk before your surprise blooms? 🌸”

User can type:

“Who are you?”

“Do you know him?”

“Why did he build you?”

🧠 Chatbot Logic (Simple + Reliable)

No API needed — use intent matching.

function botReply(msg) {
  msg = msg.toLowerCase();

  if (msg.includes("who")) return "Someone who knows how special today is 💖";
  if (msg.includes("love")) return "He loves you more than his sleep… and that says a lot 😌";
  if (msg.includes("birthday")) return "Ah… then you’re ready 🌸";
  return "Say something sweet… I’m listening 💕";
}

🔓 Bot Unlock Condition

After 5 meaningful messages, bot says:

“You’ve unlocked the final bloom… are you ready?”

Button: 🌸 BLOOM IT
